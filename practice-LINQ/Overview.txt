LINQ - Language Integrated Query
LINQ provides a common syntax that allows us to query the data from various data sources in a uniform manner.
LINQ Provider is a software component that sits between the LINQ Queries and the Data Source. 
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) providers are components that enable querying against a specific data source using the LINQ syntax in .NET

What is LINQ?
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a query syntax in C# that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from various sources (Collections, Databases, XML, etc.) using a single, consistent query language.

Why Use LINQ?
	Readable & Concise – Replaces long loops with simple queries
	Type-Safe – Errors are caught at compile-time
	Consistent Syntax – Works with Arrays, Lists, Databases, XML, etc.
	Optimized Performance – Uses lazy evaluation for efficiency

Types of LINQ Queries/Types of LINQ Providers in .NET
	LINQ to Objects - Queries collections (Lists, Arrays, dictionary, etc.)
	LINQ to SQL (Entity Framework) - Queries SQL Server databases using System.Data.Linq
	LINQ to XML (XLINQ) - Queries XML documents using System.Xml.Linq
	LINQ to Entities - Queries Entity Framework models(DbContext)
	LINQ to DataSet - Queries in-memory DataSet and DataTable

How LINQ Works?
	Data Source: Any collection (List, Array, Database, etc.)
	Query Creation: Using LINQ methods (Where(), Select(), etc.)
	Query Execution: Results are fetched when needed (lazy evaluation)

Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax
	Query Syntax (SQL-like, readable)
	Method Syntax (Fluent API, chainable)
		Both syntaxes give the same result, but method syntax is more commonly used in real projects.

Lambda Expressions in LINQ:: SYNTAX :: (parameters) => expression_or_statement_block;
	are anonymous functions used in LINQ method syntax to create concise and readable queries.

	
LINQ API in .NET
	The LINQ API is built into System.Linq and provides a set of methods to perform operations on IEnumerable<T> and IQueryable<T>.
	--> Key Namespaces in LINQ API
		System.Linq: Core LINQ methods for in-memory collections (IEnumerable<T>)
		System.Data.Linq: LINQ to SQL (for database queries)
		System.Xml.Linq: LINQ to XML (for querying XML documents)
		System.Linq.Expressions: Used for dynamic LINQ queries
	--> The LINQ API consists of:
		1. Standard Query Operators (already covered earlier)
		2. LINQ Providers (for different data sources)
		3. Deferred vs. Immediate Execution
		4. LINQ Expression Trees
		5. Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)

Deferred Execution vs. Immediate Execution
1. Deferred Execution
	Query is not executed immediately when defined.
	It is executed only when iterated (foreach, .ToList(), .First(), etc.).
	Benefits: Improves performance and reduces memory usage.
2. Immediate Execution
	Query executes immediately and returns a result.
	Methods like .ToList(), .ToArray(), .Count(), .Sum() force execution.

LINQ Expression Trees
	Expression Trees represent LINQ queries as an object model.
	Used in LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, and dynamic queries.
	Lambda expressions can be stored as data (Expression Trees) and analyzed dynamically.

Difference Between Lambda and Expression Trees
	Feature			Lambda Expression (Func<>)						Expression Tree (Expression<>)
	Execution		Directly executes								Builds a tree structure
	Use Case		In-memory collections (LINQ to Objects)			LINQ to SQL, EF, dynamic queries
	Modification	Cannot modify									Can be modified at runtime


Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)
	allows parallel execution of LINQ queries to improve performance.
	AsParallel() enables multi-threading for faster query execution.
